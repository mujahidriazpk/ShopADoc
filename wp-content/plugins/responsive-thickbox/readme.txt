Display content for any media type in a thickbox that dynamically sizes the media to match the browser window.

== Description ==

The standard WordPress Thickbox can size images dynamically to fit the user's browser window.  But what about video or other types of media. 
This plugin allows any content to be shown in a thickbox that is sized dynamically to fit the browsers window.  While a popup can be initiated 
from a link like the standard Thickbox, the plugin is intended to be used as a shortcode because more options to control the display can be supported.  
A shortcode builder form is provided so you don't need to remember all options can get the names right.

= Features =

**Dynamically sized content**

  * Images, videos and even HTML pages can be dynamically sized to fit the user's browser window
  * Optionally setup discrete sizes to show your content if it is seen best at specific resolutions

**Uses the HTML5 <video> tag to display videos**

  * Specify urls to different video formats so more browsers will be able to see your videos
  * Falls back to FlowPlayer if a browser does not support the video tag or cannot display the formats you provide

**Includes a shortcode builder**

  * No need to remember all the options available
  * Fill in the blanks and the shortcode is created ready to paste into posts and pages

**No conflict with Thickbox**

The plugin does not use or rely upon the standard Thickbox implementation.  Use both if that meets your needs.
